# StressThing
A testing platform to perform stress test on web of things. You can define you WoT system and your ideal stress config and see the result as below:


# Description
This testing platform uses **Taraus**, **Blazemeter** and **JMeter** as testing tools.
It also uses **W3C WoT Thing Description** as the primary standard for defining WoT systems.

This project aims to overcome different barriers of load and stress testing for Web of Things(WoT) by using the best testing tools and web standards for IoT. 
A notable approach of StressThing is to restrict users to use formal web standards defined for WoT in order to help increasing the interoperability of Internet of Things.
# Installation
you need to have node installed. By running this command in the project directory, all the dependencies of the project will be installed.
```bash
npm install
```
# Usage
## Test Execution Parameters
You can tune your test with these parameters (from [Taraus official Website]( https://gettaurus.org/docs/ExecutionSettings/) ):
* concurrency: number of target concurrent virtual users 
* ramp-up: ramp-up time to reach target concurrency 
* hold-for: time to hold target concurrency 
* iterations: limit scenario iterations number
* throughput: apply Request per Second (RPS) shaper, limiting maximum RPS to throughput, requires ramp-up and/or hold-for
* scenario: name of scenario that described in scenarios part
* steps: allows users to apply stepping ramp-up for concurrency and rps, requires ramp-up
## Define WoT System
* First, define each things in your Web of Things system based on JSON format of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) standard for WoT things. This standard is defined explicitly in [WoT Thing Description]( https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/).
* Put all things as the value of the "things" key in the input JSON file.
* Save the JSON file with the name "WoT_Input.json" in the root directory of the project.
* Here we have a short TD example:
```JSON
"things": [
{
    "id": "@redLight507",
    "name": "redLight507",
    "description" : "redLight507 is a red light for the 507 street",
    "properties": {
        "getTrafficStatus": {
            "description" : "Shows the current status of the traffic in front of red light",
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://6fb72f98-04cb-4010-b8ba-051062303e55.mock.pstmn.io/redLights/redLight507/getTrafficStatus",
                "http:methodName": "GET"
            }]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "putTrafficStatus": {
            "description" : "update Traffic Status",
            "input": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "density": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": "1",
                    "maximum": "30"
                },
                "volume": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": "1",
                    "maximum": "500"
                  },
                "trafficLevel": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": "0",
                    "maximum": "10"
                }
            },
            "required": ["density","volume"]
        },
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://6fb72f98-04cb-4010-b8ba-051062303e55.mock.pstmn.io/redLights/redLight507/putTrafficStatus",

        }
    },

## Define Manual Test Configs (Optional)
StressThing generate scenarios by itself as well as getting user's scenarios as input. You can also customize scenarios that are generated by StressThing.

You can define arbitrary scenarios with their corresponding settings with arbitrary names. StressThing would put your scenarios in place to be runned for each of your WoT endpoints. You should define your scenarios as the value of "scenarios" key.
```JSON
  "scenarios":[
	{
     "concurrency": "1",
      "ramp-up": "10",
      "hold-for": "10",
      "throughput": "1",
      "scenario": "BeginerScenario"
	},
	{
     "concurrency": "300",
      "ramp-up": "10",
      "hold-for": "30",
      "throughput": "30",
      "scenario": "ExtremeScenario"
  },
  {
    .
    .
    .
  }
  ]
```
You can also limit the maximum users and throughput for scenarios generated by stressThing. These settings are available under "scenarioConfigs" key:
```JSON
"scenarioConfigs":{
    "maxUser":"400",
    "maxThroughput":"50",
	  "rampUp":"30",
    "holdFor":"20"
  }
```

the modern ES2017 code is written in ./src directory. You can compile it by doing this command:
```bash
npm run build #you need to run this command if you have changed any code in ./src directory
```
This will save JavaScript ES5 code version in ./public directory. To avoid compatibility issues the ES5 code will be used for execution.

To execute the code you have to run this command:
```bash
npm run execute #This command will create the JSON file as the input for the test tool
```
the JSON file is named 'Tool_Input.json'. You can view it after running the above command.

Now you have all the ingredients to perform stress test on your WoT system. By running the command below, the test tool starts to execute the input file created in previous step.
```bash
npm run stress #This command will run the test
```
After running this command you will see test tool messages appear on your terminal. After a few seconds test tool report window will open automatically and you can see the final results of the stress test.
